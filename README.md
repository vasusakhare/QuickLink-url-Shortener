  Title: QuickLink URL Shortener with Nodejs
</h1>

Project Description:
QuickLink is an intuitive web application designed to simplify URL management. It enables users to shorten URLs, add personal notes, and keep track of click statistics. With QuickLink, you can efficiently handle your shortened URLs, annotate them with relevant notes, easily search for saved URLs and notes, and conveniently monitor click counts for each shortened URL.

  How to Run the Project:
</h2>

To run the QuickLink URL Shortener project, follow these steps:
1. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already (https://nodejs.org).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
5. In the server.js file, replace the database connection URI or you can also use it without replacing it as I have provided a valid URI.
6. Run the application: `npm run url`.
7. Access the application in your web browser at: `http://localhost:3000`.

<h2>
 Accessing the Application:
</h2>

1. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the QuickLink application.
2. Start using the application to shorten URLs, add notes, search the urls and notes and track click statistics.

<h2>
Internal working of my Project :
</h2>

The internal working of the project involves several key components and processes. Here's a breakdown of the internal workings:

   - Node.js and Express: I used Node.js as the runtime environment and Express.js as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - User Registration and Login: Users can register by providing their information, and the backend securely stores their data in a MongoDB database. When a user logs in, their credentials are verified, and if successful, a token is generated for authentication.
   - MongoDB: I utilized MongoDB as the database to store user information, including hashed passwords, using the Mongoose library for data modeling and interaction.
   - Password Hashing: To ensure the security of user passwords, I used bcrypt to hash the passwords before storing them in the database.
   - Short ID Generation: For generating short URLs, I made use of the shortid library. This allows you to generate unique and compact identifiers for the shortened URLs.
   - Number of Clicks : they are generated by incrementing the 'clicks' by 1 , each time we we click on short Url.
   

   - Bootstrap: I leveraged the Bootstrap framework to enhance the visual appearance of the application, using its predefined styles and components to create a consistent and responsive design.
   - Filtering Data: To enable searching and filtering of data, I implemented filtering on the frontend. This allows users to search and display specific data based on their input criteria.
   
   
   - Header and Footer: I implemented a header and footer component that appear consistently across the application.
